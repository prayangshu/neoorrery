NeoOrrery is a web-based Django application designed to visualize, monitor, and alert users about Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) such as comets, asteroids, and other celestial bodies. The project leverages NASA's Open APIs to fetch real-time data about celestial bodies and their close approaches to Earth, providing users with both graphical and tabular representations of planetary data and potential hazards.

## üåç Project Description

NeoOrrery is an interactive web application that provides valuable information about various celestial bodies, including planets, comets, asteroids, and Near-Earth Objects (NEOs). By leveraging data from NASA‚Äôs open APIs, NeoOrrery displays real-time information about the orbits and key characteristics of these objects, offering users a comprehensive view of their behavior in space. One of the primary focuses is on Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs), which are asteroids that may pass close to Earth and pose a risk of impact.

The platform provides various tools and features for users, including:

- A dashboard that offers detailed statistics on celestial objects like size, speed, and distance.
- Real-time alerts to notify users when objects approach close to Earth.
- An immersive 3D visualization tool that allows users to visualize orbits dynamically.

Additionally, users can create personal profiles, manage settings for alerts, and export celestial data for further research.

### üöÄ Features Overview

- Dashboard: A detailed dashboard shows real-time statistics on celestial bodies, including planets, comets, asteroids, and potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs). Data includes the size, distance, and velocity of these bodies.
  
- Real-Time Close Approach Alerts: Users are alerted when a celestial object passes within a certain distance of Earth. By default:
  - Real-Time Close Approaches Distance: 100,000 km
  - Critical Close Approaches Distance: 10,000 km
  Users can also set personalized distances for these alerts based on their preferences.

- Automated Data Updates: NeoOrrery automatically fetches the latest data from NASA's APIs:
  - Data is updated every 6 hours to ensure the latest information about celestial bodies is available.
  - Email alerts are sent to users every 24 hours if a significant close approach occurs within their chosen parameters.

- 3D Visualization: Users can explore the orbits and movement of celestial bodies in a 3D environment, providing an interactive and engaging way to understand their behavior and trajectories.

- User Profiles: Users can create personalized accounts where they can:
  - Set custom distances for close approach alerts.
  - Upload profile pictures.
  - Manage and update personal information.
  - View contributions and points.

- Contribution System & Ranking: Users can contribute blog posts or articles, and earn points based on their contributions.
  - Non-Verified Contributions: Earn 25 points each.
  - Verified Contributions: Earn 50 points each.
  - Points are accumulated, leading to a ranking system where users earn ranks such as "Rookie Explorer" and "Universe Architect."

- CSV Export: Users can download data about celestial bodies, including planets, asteroids, comets, and PHAs, for further analysis. Data can be exported in CSV format.

- Search, Filter, and Sort: The dashboard includes advanced search, filter, and sort functionality to help users find specific celestial bodies based on their size, distance, or name.

- Admin Panel: The app provides an admin panel where administrators can manage user accounts, contributions, and review submitted content.

- Secure Authentication: NeoOrrery offers secure login and logout options, password management, and user authentication using Django's built-in security mechanisms.

- Custom Error Pages: The app includes custom error pages for smooth handling of issues like 404 (page not found) or 500 (server error).

- Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive, providing an optimal experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## üåü Ranking System and Points

NeoOrrery has a ranking system that rewards users based on their contributions. Each time a user submits a blog post or contribution, they earn points, which contribute to their rank.

- Non-Verified Contributions: 25 points per submission
- Verified Contributions: 50 points per submission

As users accumulate points, their rank increases. The ranking system is as follows:

| Points Range       | Rank                   |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| 10,000+            | Universe Architect      |
| 9,500 - 9,999      | Space Voyager           |
| 9,000 - 9,499      | Quantum Pioneer         |
| 8,000 - 8,999      | Nebula Master           |
| 7,000 - 7,999      | Celestial Analyst       |
| 6,000 - 6,999      | Orbital Specialist      |
| 5,000 - 5,999      | Galactic Researcher     |
| 4,000 - 4,999      | Orbit Navigator         |
| 3,000 - 3,999      | Interstellar Scout      |
| 2,000 - 2,999      | Cosmic Observer         |
| 1,000 - 1,999      | Astro Apprentice        |
| 500 - 999          | Stellar Novice          |
| 0 - 499            | Rookie Explorer         |

## üì° Real-Time and Critical Close Approaches

In NeoOrrery, you can subscribe to alerts for close approaches based on the distance from Earth. The distances are set as follows:

- Real-Time Close Approaches Distance: 100,000 KM
- Critical Close Approaches Distance: 10,000 KM

These thresholds allow users to stay informed about potentially dangerous objects and other celestial bodies that come near Earth.
