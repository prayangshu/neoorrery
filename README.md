# 🌌 NeoOrrery: An Orrery Web App that Displays Celestial Bodies 🚀

## 🌟 High-Level Project Summary

**NeoOrrery** is an interactive tool that visualizes celestial bodies like planets, comets, and asteroids in a 3D environment. 🌍✨ It allows users to explore the solar system and track near-Earth objects (NEOs), including potentially hazardous asteroids (PHA). With real-time data integration from NASA APIs, NeoOrrery provides both educational insights and scientific data about celestial bodies, including their orbital paths, size, and distance from Earth. 🌠 The project is designed for users of all backgrounds to easily understand the dynamics of our solar system and beyond. 🌞🔭
