**NeoOrrery** is a web-based Django application designed to visualize, monitor, and alert users about Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) such as comets, asteroids, and other celestial bodies. The project leverages NASA's Open APIs to fetch real-time data about celestial bodies and their close approaches to Earth, providing users with both graphical and tabular representations of planetary data and potential hazards.

## üåç Project Description

**NeoOrrery** is an interactive web application that provides valuable information about various celestial bodies, including planets, comets, asteroids, and Near-Earth Objects (NEOs). By leveraging data from NASA‚Äôs open APIs, **NeoOrrery** displays real-time information about the orbits and key characteristics of these objects, offering users a comprehensive view of their behavior in space. One of the primary focuses is on **Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs)**, which are asteroids that may pass close to Earth and pose a risk of impact.

The platform provides various tools and features for users, including:

- A **dashboard** that offers detailed statistics on celestial objects like size, speed, and distance.
- **Real-time alerts** to notify users when objects approach close to Earth.
- An immersive **3D visualization tool** that allows users to visualize orbits dynamically.

Additionally, users can create personal profiles, manage settings for alerts, and export celestial data for further research.

## üåü Ranking System and Points

**NeoOrrery** has a ranking system that rewards users based on their contributions. Each time a user submits a blog post or contribution, they earn points, which contribute to their rank.

- **Non-Verified Contributions:** 25 points per submission
- **Verified Contributions:** 50 points per submission

As users accumulate points, their rank increases. The ranking system is as follows:

| Points Range       | Rank                   |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| 10,000+            | Universe Architect      |
| 9,500 - 9,999      | Space Voyager           |
| 9,000 - 9,499      | Quantum Pioneer         |
| 8,000 - 8,999      | Nebula Master           |
| 7,000 - 7,999      | Celestial Analyst       |
| 6,000 - 6,999      | Orbital Specialist      |
| 5,000 - 5,999      | Galactic Researcher     |
| 4,000 - 4,999      | Orbit Navigator         |
| 3,000 - 3,999      | Interstellar Scout      |
| 2,000 - 2,999      | Cosmic Observer         |
| 1,000 - 1,999      | Astro Apprentice        |
| 500 - 999          | Stellar Novice          |
| 0 - 499            | Rookie Explorer         |

## üì° Real-Time and Critical Close Approaches

In **NeoOrrery**, you can subscribe to alerts for close approaches based on the distance from Earth. The distances are set as follows:

- **Real-Time Close Approaches Distance:** 100,000 KM
- **Critical Close Approaches Distance:** 10,000 KM

These thresholds allow users to stay informed about potentially dangerous objects and other celestial bodies that come near Earth.
