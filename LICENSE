## Introduction

**NeoOrrery** is a Django-based web application that fetches and visualizes real-time data about celestial bodies from NASA APIs. It provides users with insights on planets, comets, asteroids, and potentially hazardous objects (PHAs). The application allows users to opt in for alerts on close approaches of asteroids and provides a 3D visualization of the solar system.

## Project Roadmap

### Current Stage
- **Version:** 1.0.0 (Beta)
- **Last Updated:** September 30, 2024

### Planned Features
- Real-time close approaches display without email alerts.
- Enhanced 3D visualization of celestial bodies using Three.js.
- Admin and User dashboards for managing subscriptions, data, and profiles.

### Milestones
- **v1.0** (October 2024): Beta release with real-time data fetching, alerts, and 3D views.
- **v2.0** (TBD): Integration of user-uploaded celestial body data and a fully interactive 3D orrery.

## Features

### Dashboard
- Displays statistics on celestial bodies (planets, comets, asteroids, PHAs).
- Provides filters, search, and sorting functionality.

### Close Approaches Alerts
- Notifies users via email of any close approaches based on a predefined distance threshold.

### 3D Visualization
- Renders a 3D view of celestial bodies and their orbits using Three.js.

### User Management
- Profile editing, including profile pictures.
- Email subscription management for alerts.

### CSV Export
- Download celestial body data as CSV files.

---

## Usage

### Real-Time Alerts
- The system will automatically notify subscribed users via email about close approaches of asteroids based on the set distance threshold.

### 3D View
- Access the interactive 3D visualization of the solar system from the dashboard.

### Data Export
- Download data on celestial bodies in CSV format from the data section.

---

## Architecture

- **Backend:** Django
  - Models for celestial bodies (planets, comets, asteroids).
  - Views and management commands for data fetching and alerts.
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Three.js for 3D rendering).
- **Database:** SQLite3
- **APIs:** NASA APIs for celestial data
- **Real-Time:** Celery for asynchronous tasks like data fetching and close approach alerts.
- **Media Management:** User profile pictures and team member images.
